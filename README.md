Treehouse project 1 - personal profile page

Hey anyone who reads this. 

Thanks for looking at my project. I had a lot of fun with this project. Getting lost and finding my way back many times over. I learnt a lot through the process.

I have browser tested this site extensively. It works in recent versions of Firefox, Chrome and Safari fairly reliably. It *should* also work in IE 10 and 11. I use a mac so I had to use a website for this. 

Apologies for the state of my GitHub for this project. Again, I wanted to experiment a bit with it and I did stuff up a few times and created conflicts I have no idea how to resolve. But in the end I think I got there.

Let me know what you think and how I can improve. 

Cheers,
Jennifer
